Almost 5 straight years RevenueCat has been represented to their customers via a simple website built with Webflow. While it was just enough for the beginning, the company expansion made it obvious that they had outgrown the no-code platform, which appeared to be slow, had limited code customization, and confusing traffic plan variations. They've started to look for an agency that could help with the redesign and migration to a modern JAMStack-based website and found us.

We came up with a brand-new look for the upcoming platform quite fast as the guys already had wonderful company history and tons of content to dig through and learn. However, the "what" and "how" visualization of the in-app subscriptions service by the means of illustrations and complex animations is not an easy thing to do, so it took us a good deal of iteration to make it perfect.

We reimagined a whole bunch of product, pricing, and customer pages, all the time working side-by-side with the RevenueCatâ€™s product designer to make sure the assets and visual direction we were introducing would fit into the product app neatly. The website was powered yet again by Gatsby and Headless WP, ensuring the sweatless pages creation and editing experience without compromising on performance.
