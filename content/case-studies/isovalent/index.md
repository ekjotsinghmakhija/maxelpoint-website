Isovalent is the enterprise [Cilium](https://maxel-point-website.vercel.app/case-studies/cilium) edition, which enables cloud native networking, security, and observability.

We've been working on their marketing website along with the Cilium and eBPF's ones, solving a typical enterprise problem - uniting different projects under a roof of a single brand, but keeping them distinctive and self-sufficient in terms of design in the same time.

With the help of their content team, we completely reorganised Isovalent content and revamped the design. We made use of a cool toned palette that emphasizes the weight of the company and the value of their work. Speaking of that, we also lowered down the perception barrier by illustrating complex tech ideas with engaging animations.
