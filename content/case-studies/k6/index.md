  text: My special thanks to the Maxel Point team! The crocodile animation, fantastic design and attention to detail definitely helped to make this acquisition happen. It was one of the first things pointed out [by Grafana] in our initial acquisition discussions. Our website and look-and-feel was miles ahead of competition.

We met with the guys during their rebranding from Loadimpact to k6, and they clearly showed they were ready to hit it big on the competitive market.

We took off with a visual direction that resembled a combination of an ambitious startup and a solid enterprise - a bright, violet-accented color palette around well-known content organisational patterns and marketing pages sprinkled with mascot-based entertaining animations and illustrations. We developed all the necessary marketing pages along with feature-rich blog and documentation portals using MDX, as guys wanted to be in full control and felt completely comfortable editing their content without GUI. We have also been making sure they possess every marketing asset they need, be it for post covers, swag design or an internet ad.

We have been helping them to run the platform and marketing campaigns to this day, successfully carrying out our partnership through years.
