Fonoa is the global tax automation platform that allows customers to validate tax IDs, calculate taxes, generate invoices and e-invoices, report transactions and file tax returns through a single solution. They support tax compliance at the transaction level and simplify the global tax landscape.

Fonoa is a prominent enterprise client from the fintech industry, where striking a balance between being trendy and appealing while maintaining reliability and sophistication is crucial. Keeping these key factors in mind, our journey began. The objective behind the redesign was to create a modern and sleek website that heavily relies on visually engaging graphics to showcase the wide range of Fonoa's use cases and effectively explain their products and scope.

The primary challenge we faced was designing and developing a significant number of high-quality pages within a relatively short timeframe. To overcome this, we adopted a strategy of creating a collection of captivating building blocks that could be easily mixed and matched based on the specific content of each page. By doing so, we maximized time efficiency without compromising on the overall quality, allowing us to place greater emphasis on product animations and impressive graphic elements.

We are incredibly happy with the outcome of this collaboration and are eager to further assist Fonoa in enhancing their website and increasing product visibility as they continue to expand.
