We discovered Drone CI back in 2018, during experiments with CI/CD pipelines for our projects. It was a highly customizable and perfectly scalable solution, way ahead of the competition, but as it often happens with great tools created by seasoned devs, its interface wasn't particularly user-friendly. We reached out to its author, Brad Rydzewski, and were given carte blanche to act straight away.

We went through the product back and forth, wrapping functionalities into thoughtful UI and robust UX patterns, solving problems its sole maintainer had been finding himself short-handed to work on, and soon enough Drone v1.0 was available to the community. As a cherry on top, we supplied Drone with a beautiful landing page, which, paired with refined product, immediately brought a mature look to the company. Eventually, all this led to Drone acquisition by Harness Inc.

We continued working together later on: first, we took part in developing Harness CI/CD proprietary solutions, then got back working on Drone v2.0 redesign once more, introducing long-awaited features to the community. This version is available to the public now.
