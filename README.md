## Component Folder Structure

### Each component includes

1. Main JavaScript File
2. Index File

### Each component optionally may include

1. Folder with images and icons
2. Folder with data

Also, each component may include another component that follows all above listed rules.

### Example structure

```bash
component
├── nested-component
│  ├── data
│  │  └── nested-component-lottie-data.json
│  ├── images
│  │  ├── nested-component-image.jpg
│  │  ├── nested-component-inline-svg.inline.svg
│  │  └── nested-component-url-svg.svg
│  ├── nested-component.js
│  └── index.js
├── data
│  └── component-lottie-data.json
├── images
│  ├── component-image.jpg
│  ├── component-inline-svg.inline.svg
│  └── component-url-svg.svg
├── component.js
└── index.js
```

## Code Style

### ESLint

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) helps find and fix code style issues and force developers to follow same rules. Current configuration is based on [Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Additional commands:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Run it to check the current status of eslint issues across project.

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

Run it to fix all possible issues.

### Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) helps to format code based on defined rules. [Difference between Prettier and ESLint](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html).

Additional commands:

```bash
npm run format
```

Run it to format all files across the project.

### VS Code

Following extensions required to simplify the process of keeping the same code style across the project:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

After installation enable "ESLint on save" by adding to your VS Code settings.json the following line:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll.eslint": true
}
```

You can navigate to settings.json by using Command Pallete (CMD+Shift+P) and then type "Open settings.json".

To enable Prettier go to Preferences -> Settings -> type "Format". Then check that you have esbenp.prettier-vscode as default formatter, and also enable "Format On Save".

Reload VS Code and auto-format will work for you.

## Tips & Tricks

In order to generate a poster for a video you can use ffmpeg tool. Modify `00:00:01.000` timecode option to get a desired poster quality.

```bash
ffmpeg -i https://pixel-point-website.s3.amazonaws.com/posts/2022-06-20-motion-morning-3/9.mp4 -ss 00:00:01.000 -vframes 1 video-cover-1.jpg
```
